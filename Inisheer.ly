    Inisheer is the smallest and most eastern of the three Aran Islands in Galway
    Bay off the West coast of Ireland.  Walsh wrote the tune after a visit to the
    island:
  }
  \paragraph {
    “I composed 'Inisheer' after spending the best holiday of my life on the island.
    There was no electricity on the island at that time, which was new to a Dub like me.
    I found the people and the island had something special which I never experienced before.
    I went for three days and came home three weeks later, due to a lack of money.
    I composed 'Inisheer' the next day while I was walking in the Phoenix Park dreaming of
    what I had left behind, and the peace and tranquility it gave me.”
