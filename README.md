Tunebook
========

This is my tunebook, a collection of various traditional tunes from the
English, Irish, Scottish and American traditions, in Lilypond format.

A pre-built version in PDF format is available in
[tunes.pdf](https://github.com/unixwitch/tunebook/raw/master/tunes.pdf).
To build your own version, run Lilypond on `tunes.ly`:

```
% lilypond tunes.ly
```
