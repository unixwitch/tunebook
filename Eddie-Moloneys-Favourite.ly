  \paragraph {
    Eddie Moloney was a flute player from Ballinakill, East Galway, of a musical family;
    he was son of flute player Stephen Moloney, brother of Ambrose, and father of flute
    player Seán Moloney.  He was a member of a later iteration of the famous Ballinakill
    Céilí Band, and his heyday was in the 1950’s. “Did you bring the potstick with you?”
    was Eddie’s salutation when a flute player would arrive at a session (the old wooden
    potsticks having some resemblance to a wooden flute).
